                    <p>think this was a failing on my part - not encouraging or giving them space to contribute and feel comfortable asking

        <div class="wip-same-p">
            <p>Coding is the only entertainment on those days.Because the LAHTP is gone on with very busy schedule.Because class is on
            every day,what he teaches we have to practise on the next day so there is no other time for other works.I just coded
            during those days.Does anyone else have music that they only listen to when they are working? For me, specifically with coding, Iâ€™m all
            about Retro and Synthwave. Dancy, minimal vocals, high BPM. Perfect coding music!

            us which will fast forwarded our carrer and what he taught is boost up interests towards this domain, and it courses me
            the direction how we want to go.What we learnt:Developed a site from scratch with back and front end and we started to
            put some attacks for secure coding practises,learnt 4+ languages to code for life.It shows me the direction to my carrer.
